# Agendei!

Appointment management system for clinics and self-employed professionals who work with patients in general, such as psychologists, therapists, nutritionists, personal trainers, among others.

It allows scheduling organization, patient registration, and private notes for each appointment â€” these notes are exclusively available to the responsible professional, are encrypted in the database, and our team has no active access to this information.
